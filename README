= Ticket emailer plugin for Redmine

A plugin to allow users to email new tickets / issues to Redmine's issue tracking system on a per-project level.

== Installation

1. Copy the `config/emailer.yml` to your `RAILS_ROOT/config`
2. Edit the copied file to point to your IMAP server

== Submitting an issue

Ensure the project you are submitting to has the "Ticket emailer" module enabled.

=== Structure of email

In order to submit an issue, the Project keyword needs to be correct and the sender must be a member of the project (based on "From:" email address).

=== Supported keywords

Use any of the following keywords to create issues. If the plugin can't figure out what your value for the keyword means it will simply be ignored or defaulted. All keywords unless otherwise specified will only read in the same line of text the keyword is on, other text after that line will be ignored for that keyword.

Note: Project must always be specified or the entire email will be ignored. All keywords and values are case sensitive (i.e. When specifying a tracker using "feature" will not result in the tracker being set to Feature.)

Project: Valid Project Name
Assign: email_of@valid_user.com
Status: Resolved
Priority: Urgent
Tracker: Feature
Category: My category
Attachment: Description of file that is attached to email
Description: I want this new feature... (allows multiple lines)**

** Description is a greedy field, it will take all the text specified after it. No keywords will be recognized after the description field. 

== Updating/Commenting Issues

Ensure the project you are submitting to has the "Ticket emailer" module enabled.

=== Structure of email

The subject of the email must contain #{number of the issue}, ex. "Re: Ticket #123"

=== Supported keywords

Project: Valid Project Name*
Assign: email_of@valid_user.com
Status: Resolved
Priority: Urgent
Tracker: Feature
Category: My category
Attachment: Description of file that is attached to email
Description: I want to update this new feature... (allows multiple lines)**

* Only used to specify the containing project, will not move an issue to a new project.
** Description is a greedy field, it will take all the text specified after it. No keywords will be recognized after the description field.
